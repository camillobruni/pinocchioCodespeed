CHANGELOG

0.5

The focus of this release was polishing, making everything work seamlessly and cementing the DB design. The DB Schema should remain stable from now on. Last but not least, the installation and configuration process of codespeed was greatly simplified and is now documented.

I believe codespeed is now ready for general use.
Thanks go to Joe and to Oriol Rius for their feedback, which made this posible.
